convertdate
===========

The convertdate package was originally developed as "[Python Date
Utils](http://sourceforge.net/projects/pythondateutil/)" by Phil
Schwartz. It had been significantly updated and expanded.

Available calendars:

-   Bahai
-   Coptic (Alexandrian)
-   French Republican
-   Gregorian
-   Hebrew
-   Indian Civil
-   Islamic
-   Julian
-   Mayan
-   Persian
-   Positivist
-   Mayan
-   ISO
-   Ordinal (day of year)
-   Dublin day count
-   Julian day count

The `holidays` module also provides some useful holiday-calculation,
with a focus on North American and Jewish holidays.

Installing
----------

`pip install convertdate`

Or download the package and run `python setup.py install`.

Using
-----

    from convertdate import french_republican
    from convertdate import hebrew

    french_republican.from_gregorian(2014, 10, 31)
    # (223, 2, 1, 9)

    hebrew.from_gregorian(2014, 10, 31)
    # (5775, 8, 7)

Note that in some calendar systems, the day begins at sundown.
Convertdate gives the conversion for noon of the day in question.

Each module includes a monthcalendar function, which will generate a
calender-like nested list for a year and month (each list of dates runs
from Sunday to Saturday)

    hebrew.monthcalendar(5775, 8)
    # [
    #     [None, None, None, None, None, None, 1],
    #     [2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8],
    #     [9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15],
    #     [16, 17, 18, 19, 20, 21, 22],
    #     [23, 24, 25, 26, 27, 28, 29]
    # ]

    julian.monthcalendar(2015, 1)
    # [
    #    [None, None, None, 1, 2, 3, 4],
    #    [5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11],
    #    [12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18],
    #    [19, 20, 21, 22, 23, 24, 25],
    #    [26, 27, 28, 29, 30, 31, None]
    # ]

Special Options
---------------

### French Republican

Leap year calculations in the French Republican calendar are a matter of
dispute. By default, `convertdate` calculates leap years using the
autumnal equinox. You can also use one of three more systematic methods
proposed over the years.

-   Romme, a co-creator of the calendar, proposed leap years in years
    divisible by four, except for years divisible by 100.
-   Some concordances were drawn up in the 19th century that gave leap
    years every 4 years, in years that give a remainder of three when
    divided by four (19, 23, 27, etc...).
-   Von M&auml;dler proposed leap years in years divisible by four, except
    for years divisible by 128.

You can specify any of these three methods with the method keyword
argument in `french_republican` conversion functions.

    from convertdate import french_republican

    # Romme's method
    french_republican.to_gregorian(20, 1, 1), method='romme')
    # (1811, 9, 23)

    # continuous method
    french_republican.to_gregorian(20, 1, 1), method='continuous')
    # (1811, 9, 24)

    # von Madler's method
    french_republican.to_gregorian(20, 1, 1), method='madler')
    # (1811, 9, 23)

All the conversion methods correctly assign the leap years implemented
while calendar was in use (3, 7, 11).

Baha'i
------

The Bah&aacute;'&iacute; (Bad&iacute;) calendar has an intercalary period, Ayyam-i-H&aacute;, which occurs between the 18th and 19th months.
Dates in this period are returned as month 19, and the month of &lsquo;Al&aacute; is reported as month 20.

```python
from convertdate import bahai
# the first day of Ayyam-i-Ha:
bahai.to_gregorian(175, 19, 1)
# (2019, 2, 11)
# The first day of 'Ala:
bahai.to_gregorian(175, 20, 1)
# (2019, 3, 2)
```

Before the Common Era
---------------------

For dates before the Common Era (year 1), `convertdate` uses
astronomical notation: 1 BC is recorded as 0, 2 BC is -1, etc. This
makes arithmatic much easier at the expense of ignoring custom.

Note that for dates before 4 CE, `convertdate` uses the [proleptic
Julian
calendar](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Proleptic_Julian_calendar). The
Julian Calendar was in use from 45 BC, but before 4 CE the leap year
leap year pattern was irregular.

The [proleptic Gregorian
calendar](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Proleptic_Gregorian_calendar) is
used for dates before 1582 CE, the year of the Gregorian calendar
reform.

Holidays
--------

North American holidays are the current focus of the `holidays` module,
but pull requests are welcome.

    from convertdate import holidays

    # For simplicity, functions in the holidays module return a tuple
    # In the format (year, month, day)

    holidays.new_years(2014)
    # (2014, 1, 1)

    holidays.memorial_day(2014)
    # (2014, 5, 26)

    # USA is default
    holidays.thanksgiving(2014)
    # (2014, 11, 27)

    # But there is a Canadian option for some holidays
    holidays.thanksgiving(2014, 'canada')
    # (2014, 10, 13)

    # Mexican national holidays
    holidays.natalicio_benito_juarez(2016)
    # (2016, 3, 21)

    holidays.dia_revolucion(2016)
    # (2016, 11, 21)

    # Some Jewish holidays are included
    holidays.rosh_hashanah(2014)

Utils
-----

Convertdate includes some utilities for manipulating and calculating
dates.

    from convertdate import utils

    # Calculate an arbitrary day of the week
    THUR = 3
    APRIL = 4

    # 3rd Thursday in April
    utils.nth_day_of_month(3, THUR, APRIL, 2014)
    # (2014, 4, 17)

    utils.nth_day_of_month(5, THUR, APRIL, 2014)
    # IndexError: No 5th day of month 4

    # Use 0 for the first argument to get the last weekday of a month
    utils.nth_day_of_month(0, THUR, APRIL, 2014)
    # (2014, 4, 24)

Note that when calculating weekdays, convertdate uses the convention of
the calendar and time modules: Monday is 0, Sunday is 6.

    from convertdate import gregorian

    SUN = 6

    day = gregorian.to_jd(2014, 4, 17)
    nextsunday = utils.next_weekday(SUN, day)

    gregorian.from_jd(nextsunday)
    # (2014, 4, 20)

Other utility functions:

-   nearest\_weekday
-   next\_or\_current\_weekday
-   previous\_weekday
-   previous\_or\_current\_weekday
